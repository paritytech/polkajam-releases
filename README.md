# PolkaJam releases

You will not find any PolkaJam source code here. All PolkaJam releases are currently binary only,
to avoid intentional or unintentional violation of the JAM prize's clean-room rule; see
<https://jam.web3.foundation/rules>.

The PolkaJam source code _will_ be released in the future, once the JAM prizes have been awarded.
Until then, please do not ask for it.
